# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a number of packages in this repository. This README outlines how developers should work with changesets.

## Summary

- A changeset describes a change and its impact (patch/minor/major)
- Changesets accumulate in `.changeset/` until a version bump is needed
- The `version` script consumes changesets, bumps `package.json`, updates `manifest.json`, and generates `CHANGELOG.md`
- The release workflow creates a GitHub Release and attaches the `.mcpb` package asset

## Adding a changeset

Run the following command and follow the prompts:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Select the bump type:
- **patch** — bug fixes, dependency updates, minor tweaks
- **minor** — new features, non-breaking changes
- **major** — breaking changes

## Releasing

1. Add a changeset for your changes: `pnpm changeset`
2. Commit the changeset file along with your changes
3. When merged to `main`, the release workflow automatically opens a "Version Packages" PR
4. Merging that PR triggers a GitHub Release with the `.mcpb` asset attached
